# Library Management System

This project is a **Library Management System** with two independent API services:

1. **Frontend API** - Used by library users to browse, filter, and borrow books.
2. **Admin API** - Used by admins to manage books and users.

The services communicate using **RabbitMQ** and run in **Docker containers**.
